# IOT-BASED-AUTOMATIC-FIRE-DETECTION-ALERT-SYSTEM-AND-EXTINGUISHER
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p >The rapid integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has revolutionized various domains, including fire safety and emergency response systems. This projects proposes an IoT-based automatic fire detection, alert system, and extinguisher for enhanced fire prevention and management. The system employs a network of smart sensors strategically placed in sensitive areas to continuously monitor the environment for signs of fire.The sensor nodes are equipped with advanced fire detection algorithms that can quickly and accurately identify the presence of flames, smoke, or elevated temperatures. Upon detection, the system triggers an immediate alert through a secure communication channel, notifying relevant stakeholders such as building occupants, emergency services, and facility managers.In addition to the alert system, the proposed solution includes an integrated smart extinguisher mechanism. The IoT-based extinguisher is capable of autonomously navigating to the detected fire location using real-time data from the sensor network. The extinguisher utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to optimize its path and extinguishing technique based on the type and intensity of the fire. Furthermore, the system incorporates cloud-based analytics to provide comprehensive insights into fire patterns and trends, enabling proactive measures for future prevention.
